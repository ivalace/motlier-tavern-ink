# motlier-tavern-ink

This is a sample I made to showcase my understanding of branching, interactive narratives. Using ink, I included:

- global/temp variables and randomization
- functions & data sets
- conditionals / switches
- string interpolation for custom text
- looping conditions for relevant content
